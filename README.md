# portefolio

A blog scaffold featuring react, redux, server-side rendering and a markdown editor.

Portefolio is a project of my own, but if you wish don't hesitate to make it your.

I'm open to commits.

## TODOS:

- ~~finish posts actions and reducers~~
- find a more efficient way to handle drafts (on its way)
- create tests **important**
- finish stylesheets
- implement ui animations
- implement service worker
