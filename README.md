# Portefolio

A blog scaffold featuring react, redux, server-side rendering and a markdown editor.

Portefolio is a project of my own, but if you wish don't hesitate to make it your. I'm open to commits.

## If you do so, acknowledge that:

- I'm using gulp with browserify for the moment (webpack seemed too overwhelming to me at a first glance)
- For development I'm using redux devtools extension (which is only available in chrome), since that when I've tryed to embed the native DevTools I had some performance Issues (mainly with the editor)

## Todos in an unordered list:

- ~~API endpoins refactoring (use promises instead of callbacks for mongoose queries)~~
- Find a more efficient way to handle drafts (on its way)
- Create tests (**important**)
- Implement ui animations
- Implement service worker
- Use webpack instead of browserify
